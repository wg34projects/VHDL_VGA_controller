WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net i_vgacontroller/blue_mux_o_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin i_vgacontroller/addr_rom1_o_reg[16]_i_2/O, cell i_vgacontroller/addr_rom1_o_reg[16]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
