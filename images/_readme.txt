This ZIP file contains some images that can be used for the "VGA Controller" project.

There are images with 320x240 pixels in size (for the 76800x12 ROM) as well as
images with 100x100 pixels in size (for the 10000x12 ROM).

The ".COE" files are used to initialize the ROMs using Xilinx Vivado while the equivalent ".JPG" files
can be opened with an image viewer in order to see how the images look like.
